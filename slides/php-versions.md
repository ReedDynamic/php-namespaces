### Can I use namespaces?

(hint: heck yes!)

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> First added in PHP 5.3 (2009)
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Importing of functions + constants in PHP 5.6 (2014)
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Group imports in PHP 7.0 (2015)

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> All of these versions have come and gone!

Note:

If you haven't worked with namespaces before, you might be worried that they're some bleeding edge feature.

PHP first gained namespace support in version 5.3, which was released in 2009 (and was EOL'd in 2014).

Further improvements came in PHP 5.6 and 7.0, both of which were end-of-life'd at the end of 2018.
