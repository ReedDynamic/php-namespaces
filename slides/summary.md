## In Summary:

1. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> **Encapsulate** our code + avoid conflicts
2. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Est. 2009
3. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Autoloading is a super-power!

Note:

Encapsulate + avoid name collisions

We've had them since 2009 and can use them pretty much everywhere except WordPress core

Autoloading is one of the best things since sliced bread.
