### What are namespaces?

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Encapsulation of code
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Prevent name collisions

Note:

A namespace separates your code from other developers', kind of like an auto-prefix.

PHP can't have two functions with the same name, but they can co-exist if in separate namespaces.
